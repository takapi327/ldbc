/**
 * A generic response packet that can be either an OK packet, an EOF packet, or an ERR packet.
 *
 * For most commands the client sends to the server, the server returns one of these packets in response:
 * - An [[OKPacket]] indicates that the command was successful.
 * - An [[EOFPacket]] indicates that the command was successful, but that the server has no more data to send in response to the command.
 * - An [[ERRPacket]] indicates that the command was unsuccessful.
