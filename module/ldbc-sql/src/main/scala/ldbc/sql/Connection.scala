/**
 * A connection (session) with a specific database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned within the
 * context of a connection.
 *
 * A Connection object's database is able to provide information describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its
 * stored procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This information is obtained with the getMetaData
 * method.
 *
 * Note: When configuring a Connection, JDBC applications should use the appropriate Connection method such as
 * setAutoCommit or setTransactionIsolation. Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the
 * connection's configuration when there is a JDBC method available. By default a Connection object is in auto-commit
 * mode, which means that it automatically commits changes after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been
 * disabled, the method commit must be called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will
 * not be saved.
 *
 * A new Connection object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API has an initially empty type map associated with it. A
 * user may enter a custom mapping for a UDT in this type map. When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the
 * method ResultSet.getObject, the getObject method will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for
 * that UDT. If so, the getObject method will map the UDT to the class indicated. If there is no entry, the UDT will be
 * mapped using the standard mapping.
 *
 * A user may create a new type map, which is a java.util.Map object, make an entry in it, and pass it to the java.sql
 * methods that can perform custom mapping. In this case, the method will use the given type map instead of the one
 * associated with the connection.
