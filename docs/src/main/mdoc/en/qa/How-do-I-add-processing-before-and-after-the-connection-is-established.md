# Q: How do I add processing before and after the connection is established?

## A: To add processing before and after connection establishment, use `withBeforeAfter`.

You can use the `withBeforeAfter` method when creating a Connection to invoke processes both before and after a connection is established. For example, as shown below, by passing arbitrary processes to `before` and `after`, you can output logs before and after connection establishment.

The second argument of `withBeforeAfter` specifies the type of the Before process result that will be passed to After.

```scala 3
import ldbc.connector.*

def before: Connection[IO] => IO[Unit] = _ => IO.println("Connecting to...")
def after: (Unit, Connection[IO]) => IO[Unit] = (_, _) => IO.println("Connection Closed")

val provider =
  ConnectionProvider
    ...
    .withBeforeAfter(before, after)
```

@:callout(warning)

This feature is only available when using `ldbc-connector`.

```scala 3
libraryDependencies += "@ORGANIZATION@" %% "ldbc-connector" % "@VERSION@"
```
